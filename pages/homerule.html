                <h1>Home Rule Impacts on Voter Behavior</h1>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                One of the principal questions city and state governments have is which level of government is best suited to govern? This fundamental question has shaped the United States’ politics for over one hundred years through the use of two primary models of governance – Dillon’s Rule and home rule. Over the years, political theorists have asked whether – and if so, how – these two models shape physical and behavioral spheres. Looking back at the history of Dillon’s Rule and home rule, this analysis will explore the underlying concepts and goals of the legislation and will attempt to operationalize the differences between these two models through comparing people's political engagement at the county level in states with Dillon’s Rule and counties in states with home rule legislation. Finally, vigorous data analysis will be conducted and discussed to see whether and how home rule impacts voter behavior.
                <br><h2>Literature Review</h2>
                The modern-day origins of local governance laws in the United States date back to 1886, when Iowa Supreme Court Justice John F. Dillon ruled that local jurisdictions are delegated powers by the state and may only exercise those powers expressly granted to them by the state, which resulted in a doctrine that limited local governmental powers for decades. His ruling stemmed from a mistrust of local government operations, which at the time was defined by a primarily decentralized “political machine,” where ward bosses were notoriously corrupt and governed their communities through graft and vice. Within a few short decades, however, rapid urbanization changed the country’s governance landscape, and a countermovement for “home rule” emerged—the philosophy that governance is most effective at the local level and serves the interests of citizens better than centralized government. These two legal frameworks—Dillon’s Rule and home rule—are still heavily debated today. These doctrines have been minimally studied, but broad assertions are made for and against both governance methods.
                <br><br>
                In the 1950s, an economic philosopher named Charles Tiebout theorized that residents primarily vote with their feet, living in areas where the tax structure and local services meet their individual needs the best. The Tiebout Model further validated the arguments of home rule, postulating that local authority would allow governments to respond to these very unique needs and desires of their constituents. Over the decades, many states adopted home rule legislation, delegating state legislative powers to local governments to solve anything from affordable housing to LGBT rights. One proponent of home rule argued that Dillon’s Rule stymied efforts to advance LGBT rights in some democratic cities within larger conservative states,  and other studies have shown that cities and counties with home rule are more flexible and reactive to recessions and experience less catastrophic fiscal and budgetary impacts during economic busts. This effect is most prominent at the county level, where government fiscal behavior is most affected by the presence of home rule powers. These proponents of home rule tend to argue that regionalism reduces individuals’ ability to participate in local government affairs and develop a community identity. 
                <br><br>
                However, other researchers argue that this emphasis on localism breeds incomprehensible bureaucracy and parochialism, preventing regional approaches to issues and stifling the collective voices of the disenfranchised at the state level. One study argued that state governments are also responsive to local needs, and Dillon’s Rule neither prohibits nor hinders local growth management, a major concern of home rule adherents. In fact, states which have adopted home rule legislation often experience increased fragmentation, making growth management difficult to scale to an effective geographic breadth. An additional concern of Dillon’s Rule advocates and researchers is the ability for localism to be exclusionary. Studies of Tiebout choice suggest that this sorting of governance preferences results in increased racial segregation across jurisdictions, something Dillon’s Rule proponents suggest is enabled more by home rule.  
                <br><br>
                Other academics argue that there is no impact on local governance when comparing home rule and Dillon’s Rule authority—both are capable of doing most of the things the other can. The fundamental goal of home rule is to increase the ability for local governments to effectively respond to resident needs at the local level, which would be operationalized through the comparison of voter behavior in home rule jurisdictions and Dillon’s Rule jurisdictions. If home rule increased the ability for residents to respond to issues at the local level, it is rational that the result would be an increase in voter turnout at the local level in these home rule jurisdictions. So far, there has been limited exploration of this in political research.
                <br><h2>Methodology</h2>
                For this analysis, local political engagement is best quantified at the county level since counties are generally responsible for managing local and state elections. This is also the best unit of analysis to study home rule and Dillon’s Rule, since the impacts of home rule are generally strongest at the county level. <br><br>
                To do a probabilistic simple random sample, first a sample frame including all of the counties in the United States was identified. This dataset was obtained from MIT’s election data portal and includes the total voter turnout and breakdown of the 2016 presidential election at the county level.  From this, data on the status of home rule legislation in each state was joined to the table and a random sample of 800 counties was selected from this complete dataset.<br>

                <img src="https://izzy-youngs.com/pages/images/statsfig2.PNG"><br><br>
                This sample also included census variables aggregated at the county level to compare how home rule or Dillon’s Rule might affect voting behavior among counties of varying demographic characteristics. <br>
                <img src="https://izzy-youngs.com/pages/images/statsfig3.PNG"><br><br>
                In this analysis, the null hypothesis is that the population mean for voter engagement with home rule is the same as the population mean for voter engagement without home rule, meaning there is no impact on voter engagement when factoring home rule status. The alternative hypothesis is the home rule has a positive association with voter engagement.<br>
                H<sub>o</sub>: μ<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>2</sub><br>
                H<sub>a</sub>:  μ<sub>1</sub> > μ<sub>2</sub><br>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                In an initial comparison, it appears that especially in counties with higher population that home rule legislation may impact the number of votes cast in the election.<br><br>

                However, this is calculating raw votes and not voter engagement and does not account for potential outliers. To calculate engagement, each county’s Citizen Voting Age Population (CVAP) was divided by the total number of voters in the county. This level of political engagement was charted on a histogram, and the proportion of eligible voters who did vote in each county was around .60, or 60 percent.<br><br>

                This was then subset by whether the county was located in a state with home rule legislation, and the distribution of voters was very similar.<br><br>

                It does appear that the distribution of voter engagement in counties without home rule is slightly flatter than the distribution of voter engagement in counties with it. Across population categories, voter engagement appears highest at the metropolitan and rural levels and falls slightly at the moderate-sized jurisdictions.<br><br>

                When looking at the proportion of voters by home rule status, the variability is much higher in counties where home rule is allowed by the state. This could be partially due to the larger number of counties where the state allows home rule than where the state does not allow home rule.<br><br>

                Since home rule is a dummy variable, regressions were run on other potential factors impacting voter engagement and subset by whether the county was in a state with home rule.<br><br>

                In the first regression, the percent of population which is white was compared to political engagement. This regression suggests that the higher the percent of white people in a county with home rule, the more politically engaged the county will be. Alternatively, the higher the percent of white people in a county without home rule, the lower the political engagement will be. When examining the model’s total R2, we can see that the percent of while population has a weak, positive association with political engagement.<br><br>

                In the second regression, median household income was compared to political engagement, and this strength of association was much stronger in both home rule and Dillon’s Rule states. In communities with higher median household incomes, the political engagement is much higher. <br><br>
                <img src="https://izzy-youngs.com/pages/images/stats8.png"><br><figure><center><i>Fig. 11</i></center></figure><br><br>
                In the third regression, the percent of the population without a high school education was compared to political engagement, and this model had a strong negative association in both home rule and Dillon’s Rule states. In counties with a higher percentage of eligible voters who don’t have a high school education, the political engagement is much lower. This is much more significant in counties where home rule is allowed by the state, where 37% of the variability in political engagement can be explained by education levels.<br><br>
                <img src="https://izzy-youngs.com/pages/images/stats9.png"><br><figure><center><i>Fig. 12</i></center></figure><br><br>
                In the final regression, the number of eligible voters by the total votes in each county was compared directly to the home rule status of the state. Here, there is almost no difference in voter engagement in counties in states with home rule versus counties in states without home rule, and there certainly is not a positive association between home rule and voter participation. <br><br>
                To test the hypotheses, the assumptions were checked. The data were quantitative, the sample was large, the method of sampling was random, and the population mean is being tested.<br><br>
                μ<sub>1</sub>: 0.59, μ<sub>2</sub>: 0.58, SE: 0.089, n: 800<br>
                t-statistic: Z = (μ<sub>1</sub> - μ<sub>2</sub>)/SE = (0.59 - 0.58)/0.089 = 0.112<br>
                p-value: 0.4562<br><br>
                The alpha-level of 95%, or 0.05, was chosen. In this case, the p-value is larger than the alpha level of .05, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is not accepted. It cannot be confirmed that home rule has an impact on voter participation.<br>
                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                Ultimately, home rule does have some impacts on the voter turnout in various counties, but the extent to which it impacts turnout varies considerably and could be explained by other factors. For example, in counties where the household income is high, homeowners could be more invested in local governance that preserves or increases their home values. Additionally, states may be permissive in their application of home rule, but they may also have strong preeminence laws that impact the strength of home rule across various states and municipalities. Due to the time-prohibitive nature of identifying individual home rule counties, a state’s permissive language was used as a proxy for home rule status, but just because a county is allowed to operate under home rule does not mean that it has incorporated in such a way and operates with the same authority that other home rule counties do. 
                <br><br>
                In any future analysis, it would be beneficial to incorporate individual county home rule status (not just state status) and study political behavior across election years. The presidential election in 2016 may have increased voter turnout at the county level but may not have resulted in political engagement at the county level through voting for local officials.<br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                This study showed how home rule may impact voter turnout and voter behavior, but the associations are weak and some of the ways the concepts were operationalized could be impacted by extraneous factors. This study attempted to see if there were significant changes between voter behavior that may have indicated a strong relationship between home rule and political participation, but the weak associations and lack of strong reliability and validity make it impossible to draw a confident conclusion. Additional research will need to operationalize these terms more sharply and explore voter behavior across elections.<br><br><br>
