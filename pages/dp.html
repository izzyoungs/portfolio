                <h1>2020 Census: Impact on Urban Planning</h1>
                <br><br>
                <h2>Every ten years, the federal government is faced with the impossible task of counting everyone in the country.</h2>
                With advancements in technology, data collection, and brute force computing, it is easier than ever to re-identify populations in large data sets through <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30215-3_2" title="This link leads to an article on full database reconstruction">database reconstruction</a>. To offset this risk, the Census Bureau is adding new features to its <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/2020-census-data-products/2020-das-updates.html" title="This link leads to the Census Bureau's webpage on the 2020 Disclosure Avoidance System">disclosure avoidance system</a>, one of which is <i>differential privacy</i>, in 2020.<br>
                <br><h2>What is differential privacy?</h2>
                Differential privacy is a rigorous <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy" title="This link leads to Harvard University's explanation of differential privacy">mathematical definition of privacy</a>, where privacy is measured in terms of an accumulative risk, called the "global privacy loss budget." One limits the risk of a survey participant being re-identified through randomly jittering the attributes. For example, if every attribute in the Census is jittered ± a small deviation, it is less reliable and the person is less likely to be re-identified. The higher the allowable deviation (called "noise"), the lower the risk for re-identification. The risk is set through a process colloquially referred to as "epsilon" (ϵ). An epsilon of 8 is very accurate, and the dataset can be more easily reconstructed. An epsilon of .25 is very inaccurate, but survey participants' data is considered more private and protected.<br>
                <img src="https://izzy-youngs.com/pages/images/dp_image.png" class="responsive" alt = "Two people icons, one with demographic information and another with slightly different demographic information underneath">

                <br><h2>But what does that mean for planners?</h2>
                When the Census Bureau sets epsilon, it decides how much to budget for privacy loss. If it sets the epsilon too low, the reliability of the data is almost entirely lost. Urban planners should analyze the statistical variation and contemplate the consequences of changed attributes in order to make better decisions about how trustworthy and reliable the data they are using is. Common topics of analysis for urban planners are measures for poverty, race, ethnicity, residential segregation, vacancy, and transportation. These measures are ideal for assessing the accuracy lost in the 2020 DAS.<br><br>

                To the right is the total population of the District of Columbia by block group from the 2010 Census. It reflects the true data that was collected in the last Decennial Census. The map next to it shows very little difference, but the population numbers in each census block group are slightly different.
            <br><br>
            While the colors have barely changed, the numbers inside the block groups have changed. That is because the data reflected in this map has been processed through an algorithm that adds noise to each attribute.
            <br><br>
            Theoretically, the statistics for every category are supposed to be maintained. Let's do a 1:1 comparison.
            <br><br>
            This map shows the difference between the population numbers in each block group. The differentially private numbers are anywhere from 95% to 104% of the true data collected in 2010.
            <br><br>
            While the colors and ratios changed very little, the data actually changed quite a bit. What impact could this have?
            <br><br>
            Let's look at occupancy, vacancy, and age demographics to learn more.
            <br><h3><i>"Policymakers and planners use small-area data from the ACS and decennial census to understand local environments and focus resources where they are needed. Businesses use the data to estimate future demand and determine business locations"</i></h3>
            The map on the left shows the number of occupied housing units by block group in the true 2010 Census data. It suggests that most of the occupied housing was within the central North/South corridor through the District.
            <br><br>
            The map on the right shows the differentially private data. While it again showed little difference, it is easier to see in this one that a change has happened. Let's look more closely at what happened with the data.
            <br><br>
            The change in this data is much more significant, with the differential privacy adding noise that changes the attributes from 87% up to 112% of the true data.
            <br><br>
            The impact this may have on assessing the needs of block groups is significant and worthy of further study.
            <br><br>
            Let's look at vacancy, another indicator that urban planners use to assessing housing needs.
            <br><br>
            The map on the left shows the true vacancy rate from the 2010 Census. This rate may be used to identify which block groups are facing significant housing shortages, which could be used to identify tools to increase development in certain regions.
            <br><br>
            The differentially private data on the right is significantly different, with the vacancy rate jumping to zero in many block groups, a rare occurrence in reality. How different was this change?
            <br><br>
            The differentially private data is up to 2,700% higher than the true data for this category and a significant number of block groups are less than 15% of the true data.
            <br><br>
            While this is likely a mathematical error, this is a perfect illustration of what can go very, very wrong with algorithms. This dataset shows a completely inaccurate portrait of vacancy rates in the District, and could negatively impact decision-making if there are no internal benchmarks for identifying outliers.
            <br><h3><i>"The data are routinely used to construct contextual measures that control for neighborhood effects on health and disease. Investigators exploit policy discontinuities across time and space, disasters, and weather events as natural experiments that allow causal inferences."</i></h3>
            Finally, let's look at age. The map on the left shows the number of people over the age of 85 in each block group. This map could help assist planners in determining where to locate assisted living facilities, additional bus routes, or even as a way to plan for emergencies.
            <br><br>
The map on the right shows the differentially private data. The smoother gradient of senior population in the previous map is disappearing here, and there is a much more significant deviation from one block to another.
<br><br>
The variation is between 0% and 840% of the true data, which could lead to unfair distribution of resources, or worse, a miscalculation in where effort should be concentrated during natural disasters and catastrophes.
<br><br>
While the data privacy is increasingly important, the application of differential privacy, if it changes data this significantly, could be a huge shift for the way urban planners utilize Census data.
<br><br>
And while all of this may be terrifying, it is not to say that these problems are not already inherent in the truly colossal task of counting the population. Without even accounting for differential privacy and other disclosure avoidance techniques, the census...
<br><br>
"...could undercount the US population by 1.22 percent nationally and as much as 2 percent in states like California and Texas"
<br><br>
It may be time for urban planners to look elsewhere for comprehensive and accurate composites of geographies. Efforts to link state and federal administrative data to create more complete population counts, as well as acquiring some commercial data, could fill in the gaps created by efforts to protect the privacy of citizens.
